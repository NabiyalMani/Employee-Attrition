# Executive Summary
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for companies worldwide, leading to performance losses and associated costs. To address this issue, this project aims to identify employee satisfaction levels, dissatisfaction factors, and reasons for attrition within organizations. By understanding these factors, management can take action to reduce attrition rates.

# Scope & Objectives
Assess employee satisfaction and working conditions.
Identify factors causing employee dissatisfaction with company policies and norms.
Find areas where the company may be falling short.
Determine the reasons for attrition.
Find ways to reduce attrition within the organization.

# Approach & Methodology
Data provided by IBM on Kaggle was processed and cleaned. Classification algorithms were employed to predict attrition based on various independent variables, including gender, workplace distance, stock level, salary hikes, and more. Variable importance and probabilistic approaches were used to identify factors influencing attrition. Model performance was evaluated to select robust models.

# Recommendations & Actionable Insights
Recommendations include timely communication with employees to prevent attrition. Predictive models are linked to actionable insights, aiming to intervene in attrition situations effectively.

# Project Overview
Attrition is a universal issue impacting businesses, resulting in costs such as business disruption, hiring, and training. Identifying and minimizing staff attrition is crucial. Classification models can predict attrition, but human intervention is essential to address the underlying causes.
